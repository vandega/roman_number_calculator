V 1.0

    Works correct,
    
    lowercase detect and uppercase convrtor  exp:  a => A,   b = B,    B = B...

    Incorect input control.

    range also 499, but easy to edit code just need to add some new values as {500, "D"}, {1000, "M"} and add code pices in int_to_roman.

    code has fragments and global values for easyer access.

    easy to edic

    Code more easy to undertand
